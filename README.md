# Bayesian methods, machine learning and decision theory

This notebook follows part of Chapter 5 of [1], with the aim of
* Giving an example of how Bayesian methods work (in particular using Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods and their PyMC3 implementation).
* Introducing decision theory (loss function) to make Bayesian optimal predictions.
* Comparing with traditional (maximum likelihood) machine learning methods.
